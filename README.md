# ResetProblameticWindowsNetworkAdapters

A simple powershell script that gets network adapters that report a problem, "Uninstalls" these adapters and then restarts the pc.
This script was written to aid in reseting a Intel wifi6 adapter that randomly stops working every so often.
I'm not planning on updating this script.
